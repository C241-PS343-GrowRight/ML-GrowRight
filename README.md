# ðŸ“¤ Repository for Machine Learning Implementation
## Neural Network Regression Model
This repository contains code to preprocess data, train a deep neural network (DNN) model for regression, and convert the trained model to TensorFlow Lite format. The model predicts multiple target variables based on input features.

### Requirements
- `Python` 
- `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis.
- `tensorflow`: For building and training the neural network.
- `scikit-learn`: For preprocessing and splitting the data.
- `matplotlib`: For plotting the training and validation loss.

## Installation
#### Clone this repository:
    git clone https://github.com/C241-PS343-GrowRight/ML-GrowRight.git
    cd yourrepository

### Install the required Python packages:
    pip install -r requirements.txt
